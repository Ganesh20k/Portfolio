            <h5>Java Full Stack Developer</h5>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Ganesh K, a passionate and dedicated Java Full Stack Developer with a strong academic fundation in Microbiology and a drive to succeed in the world of software development. My journey into tech stems from a curiosity to understand how technology transforms industries and improves lives, combined with a deep desire to build solutions that are efficient, scalable, and user-focused.<br><br>
    I hold a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Microbiology, which honed my analytical thinking, research skills, and attention to detail. Transitioning into full stack development, I've completed professional traing in java technologies and gained hands-on experience in building web applications using modern tools and frameworks.<br><br>
    From developing responsive front-end interfaces to desingning robust back-end systems, I enjoy working across the full stack. I'm skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, java,MySQL, and have experience using tools like VS Code, Eclipse, and platforms like GitHub for version control. I also bring strong soft skills in team collaboration, adaptability, and problem-solving, which i refined through academic projects, internships, and certifications.<br><br>
    I've worked on real-time projects and case studies during my training and am eager to contribute meaningfully to tech-driven teams. My background in science and my skills in development allow me to approach problems logically and offer well-rounded solutions.<br><br>
    Now, I'm seeking opportunities where i can apply my full stack skills to develop impackful applications and continue growing as a developer in a dynamic and challenging environment.
